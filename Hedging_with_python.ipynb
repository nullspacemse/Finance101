    "The primary aim of this exercise is to set up a **cross hedging** scenario by using **monthly price changes**. Recall that a **cross hedge** is essentially a type of hedging strategy wherein the asset that exposes an investor to price volatility in the cash market, is offset by having a position in the futures market such that the underlying asset is different from the asset causing us exposure. The methodology in this analysis consists of the following key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hedge Ratio**: In a cross hedging scenario, correlations between the underlying asset and asset causing price risk, are usually quite different. The main attempt is to have a **minimum variance hedge ratio** and is given by the expression below. Note in addition that this obtained by the **slope** of the best fit line by regressing **change in spot price** on **change in futures price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^* = \\dfrac{\\rho\\sigma_S}{\\sigma^F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hedge effectiveness**: This is the proportion of variance that is eliminated by hedging. It is essentially the **goodness of fit** or $R^2$ measure from our regression results and is also denoted by $\\rho^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data preparation**: Data is prepared by **backadjusting** using the **nearest month approach** so as to obtain a continuous series of futures prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing the model**: Finally the model is tested on a **holdout sample** so as to judge the hedge effectiveness on the new data.\n",

    "- Suppose there is a **23 April 2020** future contract and the date today is also **23 April 2020**. Also suppose that on the same date there is another contract of **5 June 2020** existing on the same date. Now it is obvious that both these contracts would have had different historical price values. This is the reason that **gaps** are usually noticed in futures data. Now to correct this and make it continuous, we take the difference of the **date of expiry** contract of **23 April 2020** and find the difference in its price that day, with that of the **nearest month** future contract, which in this case is **5 June 2020**. Suppose the difference in price is $+7.25$. Then we would essentially add this amount to **all** the futures contract values before that date. This smooths out the gaps and makes the series continuous.\n",

We essentially extend our model to predict for future spot prices, under the assumption that the true relationship between the variables remains quite similar. It is only then that our model predictions of the future will have some semblance with actual values, thereby making our **hedge effective**. Noting that **hedge effectiveness** is actually given by either the **goodness of fit** of the regression model or the **correlation squared**. The $\\rho^2$ for the test set has been calculated so as to get a sense of the true hedge effectiveness in the future.\n",

The loss due to price drop in the stock was **offset** by a corresponding gain in the futures market. Hence in this project it is clear that:\n",
