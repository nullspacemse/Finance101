    "# The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are $100$ coins in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $99$ of those coins are fair and $1$ is biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. This means that the probability of randomly picking a fair coin is $0.99$ and the probability of picking a biased coin is $0.01$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(fair) = 0.99, P(biased) = 0.01$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Further, the fair coin is associated with an equal probability of heads or tails ($0.5$) whereas the biased coin favors heads with a probability of $0.75$ and tails with a probability of $0.25$. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note that our **prior belief** that a coin is fair is $0.99$ - just the prior probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Conducting the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we toss the coins randomly, we are interested in knowing as to **how is it that tossing the coin and observing a result, alters our belief of the coin being fair**. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suppose we toss first and get a head. What should then the **posterior belief** be ? The posterior belief means that **how confident are we that given a heads on the first toss, that the coin that was tossed, was a fair coin ?**. The quantity we are interested in is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(fair|heads)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We then tend to revise our beliefs based on this new information - these are **posterior beliefs**. We find the posterior as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(fair|heads) = \\dfrac{P(heads|fair)P(fair)}{P(heads|fair)P(fair) + P(heads|biased)P(biased)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(fair|heads) = \\dfrac{0.99 \\times 0.5}{(0.99 \\times 0.5) + (0.01 \\times 0.75)} = 0.9850$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now the central idea is this - when we toss a **second** coin, then we **update** our initial prior in the previous step with the **new prior** which is nothing but the **old posterior belief**. So the new prior would be $0.9850$. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will see now what the model becomes if we observe two heads - that is in the second time step also we get a heads. Heads at time $1$ is called $h_1$ and heads at time $2$ is called $h_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(fair|\\{h_1, h_2\\}) = \\dfrac{P(fair|h_1)\\times P(h_2|fair)}{(P(h_2|fair)P(fair|h_1) + P(h_2|biased)P(biased|h_1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\dfrac{0.9850 \\times 0.5}{(0.9850 \\times 0.5) + (0.015 \\times 0.75)} = 0.9776$$\n",

    "# Bayesian Market Maker\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The market maker's prior belief about a stock's value is that it will be worth $V = 120$ with probability $0.5$ or worth $V = 80$ with probability $0.5$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dealer is interested in knowing the **degree of belief about the value of the stock at future time slots** by considering the **evidence** of a buyer or a seller approaching him. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assume the situation wherein we have $2$ informed buyers, $5$ uninformed buyers and $5$ uninformed sellers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let us say that at time $1$ the dealer gets a buyer. He would then revise his belief of the value of stock as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(V = 120|b) = \\dfrac{P(b|V = 120)P(V=120)}{P(b|V = 120)P(V = 120) + P(b|V = 80)P(V = 80)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\dfrac{(7/12)\\times (1/2)}{((7/12) \\times (1/2)) + ((5/12) \\times (1/2))} = \\dfrac{7}{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The rationale behind the above computation is this - **only the informed traders know that the price would actually be $120$ at time $1$** - so this implies that **all the buyers** (including the informed traders) will bid for the stock. However, if the value at time $1$ were $80$ then **only the uninformed traders** would bid and **not the informed traders**. That is why the ratio of $7/12$ is associated with the probability of value being $120$ whereas the ratio os $5/12$ is associated with the probability of the value being $80$. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using a similar calculation approach we can get the **posterior belief of the value being $V = 80$** as $5/12$. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finally, based on this, the market maker sets his **expectd valuation** based on the next traders being a buyer by taking the weighted posteriors along with possible values that the stock can take (This is essentially the dealer's **ask**):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(V|b) = \\dfrac{7}{12}\\times 120 + \\dfrac{5}{12}\\times 80 = 103.34$$\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If supposing the next trader was a seller then the posterior for value being $V = 120$ would be given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(V = 120|s) = \\dfrac{(5/12)\\times (1/2)}{((5/12) \\times (1/2)) + ((7/12) \\times (1/2))} = \\dfrac{7}{12} = 5/12$$\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If the next trader was a seller then the posterior for value being $V = 80$ would be given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(V = 80|s) = \\dfrac{(7/12)\\times (1/2)}{((5/12) \\times (1/2)) + ((7/12) \\times (1/2))} = \\dfrac{7}{12} = 7/12$$\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Here the rationale is the exact opposite - informed traders would want to sell if they **knew that the stock price will fall to $80$** whereas the uninformed sellers would always come regardless of the price. Finally, the dealer's **bid** would be set as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(V|s) = \\dfrac{5}{12}\\times 120 + \\dfrac{7}{12}\\times 80 = 96.67$$\n",
